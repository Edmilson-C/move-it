# Move It

## Introduction
Move-It is Next.JS app created to help reminding people, who stay long hours on front off a computer, to take a little break.

## How does it work
The app has levels and to level up, the person/user has to complete challenges.
The person/user has 25min(can be changed) to work(on front off the computer) and after this time, the app warns the person/user to take a break.
Each break has a challenge which the person/user has to complete, and each challenge has its own XP.
Each level has its own required XP which the person/user has to reach to level up.
